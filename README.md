# Chat-App
A simple chat app a partner and I created for a class.
This code basically uses the concepts of multithreading, sockets, and ports to create a multi user chat application.
Once a user connects to the server, the user then must create his/her own username.
The user will now be able to communicate with other users connected to the same server.
